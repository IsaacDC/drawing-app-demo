This is a simple, collaborative live drawing application built with Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO. The current code serves as a concept demo for a larger-scale project I'm developing.

This repository allows me to visualize the mobile experience and test the drawing functionality for multiple users interacting simultaneously.

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

```bash
     cd canvas_testing
```
```bash
    npm install
```
```bash
    node app.js
```

You can also explore the demo hosted on a small server via Render: https://canvas-testing.onrender.com.

For the larger-scale project, I have integrated a database for more robust data management and implemented Redis for tracking users and their drawings.

Ignore all the commits lol
